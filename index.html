        What is TEDx?
        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx.
        TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.
        Our event is called TEDx[name], where x = independently organized TED event.
        At our TEDx[name] event, TED Talks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection
        in a small group.
        The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours,
        are self-organized.
